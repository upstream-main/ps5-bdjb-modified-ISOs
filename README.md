## Auto Jailbreak and HEN ALL-IN-ONE ISO for 3.xx-7.xx (up to 12.00 with BDJ-UNPATCH) (Poopsploit for full jailbreak not ported yet)

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i am on 7.61 so thats the firmware version i test on
<br />

<br />
Thanks!

<br /> 

## Beta ISO versions:
My latest ISO betas are available on my [ko-fi shop](https://ko-fi.com/viktorious/shop) for 0€+
<br /> 

My latest ISO beta: [v20BETAv2](https://ko-fi.com/s/ce844a3276) (OUTDATED) (MORE BETAS SOON)
<br /> 

These are outdated, I havent't done beta testing for the past 2 versions
<br /> 
<br /> 

## Custom ISO versions:
I can create you a custom iso version for your liking
<br /> 

What I can change:
- Icons (Pipeline, Disc, USB, Remote)
- Thumbnail (the AUTO JAILBREAK ICON and Title too)
- All the text overall - I can translate the iso to another language etc
- customize pipelines 
- and more!
<br /> 

DM me on discord: viktorious_x for pricing and details.
<br />
<br /> 
<br /> 


## Tutorial: 
<br />
Burn the latest iso on your BD disk using imgburn (or any other preferred software), run the disk on your ps5 and select any pipeline (i reccomend 1. pipeline), Once the process is finished you will be on the home menu and etahen will be automatically loaded as soon as you are on the home screen. 
<br />
Enjoy!
<br />

<br />

<br />

If you have a BD-r and you still want to edit files on the iso in the future here is a tutorial by [nas7536](https://www.youtube.com/@nastechdsi):
<br />
It's built into Windows
Double click the disc in Explorer, select "like a USB flash drive", copy the files from the ISO (do not copy the ISO itself), then right click on the disc -> Eject
<br />

<br />
download source code zip instead of iso if you wanna use this method!
<br />
<br />

## Etahen configs & other stuff
<br />
<br />
Etahen is loaded from the disc normally, but if you dont want to update iso to update etahen you can either have etaHEN.bin on your usb ROOT formatted in exfat or in your data folder on your ps5.
<br />

The way it checks where to load from is in this order: USB, /data on ps5 and then if those two dont have etaHEN.bin on there it will load it from the disc itself - Huge thanks to
 [BenNox_XD](https://github.com/BenNoxXD) for making this a thing, he is the developer behind it

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### Here is the full list of configs for etahen/kstuff
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

```
1.Default: etaHEN will be loaded from the disc, and you don't have to change anything.

2. etaHEN only: Copy an etaHEN.bin file to the root of a USB drive (priority 1) or to the /data/ directory (priority 2) on the PS5, and it will be loaded instead of the one from the disc.

3. Kstuff only: Same as above, but with kstuff. Copy a kstuff.elf to the root of a USB drive (priority 1) or to the /data/ directory (priority 2) on the PS5, and it will be loaded instead of etaHEN.

4. Combined: Place both etaHEN.bin and kstuff.elf on the root of a USB drive (priority 1) or in the /data/ directory (priority 2) on the PS5, and place a no_kstuff file on the USB root or in /data/etaHEN/. Now etaHEN will be loaded, followed by kstuff.
It is also supported for etaHEN and kstuff to be in different locations. For example, etaHEN can be on the USB and kstuff in the /data/ directory.
```

## Explanation of what you can do with this ISO

<br />
Pipelines are a sequence of payloads run so it will run the payloads all in one sequence so you dont have to do it yourself, its easier and faster and automated that way.
<br />
theres 6 pipelines in total, I will divide it into 4 categories: ALL-IN-ONE, NormalJailbreak, NOetaHEN, kstuff
<br />
<br />

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### All-In-One pipelines:

<br />
These pipelines have everything you would want
<br />

#### What it runs: UMTX - ELF LOADER- WEB SERVER - BACKPORK -  SHADOWMOUNT - ETAHEN (kstuff included) 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### Jailbreak-ONLY pipelines

<br />
These pipelines are more simplified and has the minimal you need as fast as possible
<br />

#### What it runs: UMTX - ELF LOADER - ETAHEN (kstuff included) 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### kstuff pipelines

<br />
All-In-One and Jailbreak-ONLY pipelines with kstyff being loaded instead of etaHEN
<br />

#### What it runs: Whatever All-In-One and Jailbreak-ONLY pipelines run, but with kstuff instead of etaHEN.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### NOetaHEN pipelines

<br />

#### Notice! This is no longer needed since BenNox_XD fixed etahen issue with etahen crashing bdj, but the no etahen pipelines can be still used for other purposes, for example testing purpuses
<br />

#### These pipelines are the same versions of the ones before, but without the etaHEN in the end, so theres no need for timing closing disk player so you wouldnt get kp.
#### What it runs: Everything until etahen.
